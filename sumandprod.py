# The Sum and Product Puzzle

# X and Y are two different whole numbers greater than 1
# Their sum is not greater than 100
# S and P are two perfect logicians
# S knows the sum X + Y
# P knows the product X Ã— Y
# Both S and P know all the information in this section

# In the following conversation, both participants are always telling the truth:
# S says "P does not know X and Y."
# P says "Now I know X and Y."
# S says "Now I also know X and Y."

# What are X and Y?
